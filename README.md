# one-click-cold-emails
A resourceful one-click-run tool to use to help in job hunting

Cold Emails are one of the integral parts of the jon hunting process for anyone. When dealing with the same process, It was evident that emailing everyone separately is a very tedious task and can be cumbersome. So I put on my automation hat and tried ease out the email sending process,assuming the same email content is to be sent to every recipient.

There are two yml files:
- main_email_list.yaml - This is where all the recipient info goes in. Please follow the same yaml file format which is shown in the commented examples.
- sender_info.yaml - This is where the sender info is stored. Follow the same format to store your email credentials.


PS - If your (professional) email provider does not allow a code based email sending facility. Please reach out to them for an SMTP relay informataion which will allow you to mask your email.
